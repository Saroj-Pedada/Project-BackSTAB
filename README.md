# Project-BackSTAB
#GamingWithPython

This is my first - big - gaming - project fully made using PYTHON

This is a combination of 5 games - BINGO , BOLLYWOOD , TOLLYWOOD , SNAKE WATER GUN Games !

I can't give the full information like how to play , right now . You can play the game and understand
"how to play" and all . As far as I know , most Indians know these games . I guess these have started vanishing
beacuse all are interested in online games and all . 

So , for the my guys who know these games and want to play with this interesting Python Game can enjoy this game .

You can even make modifications in the game and enjoy ---> Like using my SNAKE WATER GUN Gme , you can create STONE / ROCK PAPER SCISSORS Game

Hope you like it . Enjoy !

INSTALLATION GUIDE : Install all the files given in the "CODE" into one single folder and click on the python file named "BackSTAB.py" and ENJOY !

NOTE : You can't play them individually . If you wish to play them individually , then edit the python file : remove the first line "def :" , then you are good to go . Again put that line back if you want to play the combined game . There are no problems with my code (Hopefully) - So , don't mess up yourself and say it doesn't work . But , if you are sure there is a problem , you can inform me ... It will be very helpful .

P.S. : I shall keep the instruction , how to play ... ASAP ---> To give you the interest to try it :)
